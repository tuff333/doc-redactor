## 🔮 Future Work

The Doc‑Redactor backend is fully functional and modular.  
The following enhancements are planned for future releases:

### 🔧 Accuracy Improvements
- Table‑aware span detection  
- Regex‑based field extraction  
- Multi‑line field grouping  
- Numeric pattern detection  
- Chemical name detection  
- Expanded training dataset (50–100+ examples)

### 📊 Evaluation Tools
- Precision/Recall/F1 per document  
- Confusion matrix  
- Error analysis reports  

### ⚡ Performance Enhancements
- GPU‑accelerated training  
- Optimized spaCy configuration  

### 📝 Logging & Analytics
- `training_logs/` directory  
- Timestamped logs  
- Metrics per epoch  

### 🗂️ Model Versioning
- Automatic version folders (`model_v1/`, `model_v2/`, etc.)  
- Timestamp‑based versioning  
- Easy rollback  

These improvements will be implemented iteratively as the project evolves.
